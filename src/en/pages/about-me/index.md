headerImageAlt: This image captures a beautiful coastal landscape at sunrise at Cabo Rojo. The foreground features tall, golden wild grasses swaying in the breeze, illuminated by the warm glow of the setting sun. The middle ground showcases rolling hills leading to a rugged cliffside that extends into the ocean. In the background, the sun casts a golden hue over the horizon, reflecting off the distant waters. The sky is a soft gradient of blue and orange, with scattered clouds adding depth to the serene and picturesque scene.

### Who am I?

With over 18 years of experience across government and private sectors, I am a Software & Data Engineering Leader who builds systems that serve people. My focus is on guiding teams, designing scalable platforms, and delivering data and AI solutions that amplify human impact.

At 18F, I led engineering efforts for agencies such as the USDA and the White House, mentoring engineers, refining processes, removing blockers, and advancing security compliance (NIST, ATO). My work included introducing CI/CD pipelines, shaping hiring guidelines for the U.S. Digital Corps, and driving high-profile projects like the AmeriCorps ACC.gov launch and the open-sourcing of the Piipan Azure/.NET platform.

When 18F was closed in 2025, I transitioned to the private sector. That path led me to Edulogika, where I was entrusted to refactor and scale their data platform to support smoother onboarding and future growth.

Today, as AI and Data Delivery Manager, I lead both Data and AI teams, bringing them together at the heart of delivery. My mission hasn’t changed: whether in public service or the private sector, I aim to design secure, resilient, and human-centered systems that empower teachers, amplify their impact, and ultimately serve the public good.

Beyond work, I live in Puerto Rico, where I balance my passion for technology with family life and a strong focus on mental and physical health. My days start early with workouts, audiobooks, and reflection, building the discipline and clarity that carry me through the rest of the day. I’m also active in real estate, committed to continuous learning, and curious about emerging technologies. Whether it’s a conversation on leadership, innovation, or the next big investment, I’m always open to sharing ideas and building connections.
