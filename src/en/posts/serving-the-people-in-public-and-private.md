Today’s shutdown is a reminder of how hard public service really is. It takes me back to March 2025, when GSA shut down the [18F](https://18f.org/) office. Dozens of high-performing, mission-driven professionals were suddenly deemed non-critical. Many were locked out of systems overnight, told their unit was eliminated by direction from the top.

That closure was not abstract to me. It was personal. I saw allies, peers, and friends whose work was cut short, yet their dedication to serving the people endures, leaving a mark on civic tech that continues to inspire.

I was not part of that final wave. My last day was February 28 under the Deferred Resignation Program, a path I chose as remote work was being phased out. I never imagined that as I shut my laptop, the chapter was closing not just for me, but for the entire office. Just a few hours later, after I logged off for the last time, GSA announced at 1 a.m. the closure of the 18F office.

The timing was surreal, and now, amid yet another government shutdown impacting countless federal colleagues, I feel deep empathy for those still navigating such uncertainty.

After leaving federal service, I entered a period of stealth, reshaping my path and working through a transition behind the scenes. Through it all, Edulogika gave me cover, trust, and support. They entrusted me to refactor their data platform, making it more flexible and better prepared for future onboarding. That work connected directly to Edulogika's mission: supporting teachers and amplifying their impact with data and AI solutions.

This week marks the start of a new phase. I will be managing not only the data team I have been working alongside, but also the AI team, bringing both together at the heart of delivery.

And while my context has shifted from government to private sector, my mission has not changed. What I learned in public service stays with me: my goal, always, is to serve the people. Holding on to that mission also means looking out for those still serving in government today.

Take a pause. Look around for the federal workers in your life and show them support. It matters more than it seems. And if you’d like to learn more, or join the #ISupportFeds campaign, you can do so here: [Partnership for Public Service](https://lnkd.in/eydZ4GB7).
