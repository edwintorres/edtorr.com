 ## 🛠 Technologies Used

* Eleventy → Static site generator used to build the website
* Nunjucks → Template engine for dynamic content
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript → Core web technologies
* Markdown → Used for blog content

## 🌍 Language Configuration

The site detects the user's preferred language and redirects them accordingly. Supported languages:

* English (/en/)
* Spanish (/es/)

*If a user's language isn't supported, the site defaults to English (/en/).*

## 📌 How to Run Locally

*NodeJS and NPM are required.*

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/edtorr.com.git
cd edtorr.com
```

2. Install dependencies (if any)
```
npm install 
```

3. Run the local development server
```
npm run serve

Visit your local site: http://localhost:8080/
```


## 🔑 Environment Variables

This project requires different environment variables for building and deployment. Ensure they are set in your hosting environment or GitHub Actions secrets.


### 🏗️ Build Environment Variables (Used for Eleventy Build)

These variables are used by Eleventy during the build process:
```
NODE_ENV=production  # Ensures Eleventy creates a production-ready build
```
`NODE_ENV`=production enables optimizations and disables unnecessary development features when running npm run build.

### 🚀 Deployment Environment Variables (Used by GitHub Actions)
These variables are required for deployment via SSH:

```
SSH_PRIVATE_KEY=your-ssh-key
SSH_USER=your-ssh-username
SSH_HOST=your-server-host
SSH_PORT=your-ssh-port
```
Set these variables in GitHub Actions secrets for automated deployment.


## 🌿 Branching Strategy

* `main` → Production (Live site, no direct commits)

## 🚀 Deployment

This site is automatically deployed via GitHub Actions when pushing to main. The deployment process:

1. Build the site using `Eleventy` 
```
npm run build
```

2. Deploy using rsync over SSH.
